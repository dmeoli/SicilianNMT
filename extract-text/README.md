#  Sicilian Translator / extract-text

Our largest source of parallel text are issues of the literary journal [_Arba Sicula_](http://www.arbasicula.org/), a bilingual journal of Sicilian history, language, literature, art, folklore and cuisine.

The pages on the left are in Sicilian.  The pages on the right are in English.

It's an excellent source of parallel text, but first we have to extract it from PDF format.
