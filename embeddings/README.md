# Sicilian_Translator / embeddings

If we train word embeddings from the Sicilian language text in our parallel corpus, we can use those embeddings to create lists of context similar words for the lemmas in [_Chiù dâ Palora_](https://www.napizia.com/cgi-bin/cchiu-da-palora.pl).

And because we trained word embeddings, we also created some word clouds just because we could.  These visualizations don't tell us much, but they we fun to create.
