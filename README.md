# Sicilian Translator

This repository uses [MXNet Gluon NLP](https://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/machine_translation/gnmt.html) and [Sennrich et al's subword-nmt](https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt) to create the neural machine translator at [_Napizia_](https://translate.napizia.com/).

Many newer translation frameworks are available (for example: [Sockeye](https://awslabs.github.io/sockeye/), which is based on MXNet), but the simplicity of Gluon's framework makes it a great place to start, especially when you're still assembling data, as we are here.

Nonetheless, I edited it to incorporate dropout into the attention and embedding layers.  To improve translation quality in low-resource conditions, I incorporated Sennrich's subword splitting.  And I added BLEU score calculations for alternative translation test sets.  (So for example, you can calculate one BLEU score for translations of poetry and another BLEU score for translations of prose).

The dataset of parallel text that we are assembling draws from issues of [_Arba Sicula_](http://www.arbasicula.org/) and from [Arthur Dieli](http://www.dieli.net/)'s translations of Giuseppe PitrÃ¨'s [_Folk Tales_](https://scn.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A0uli,_nueddi_e_cunti_pupulari_siciliani) and of Sicilian poetry and proverbs.  They gave us a very large amount of data to assemble, so we look forward to putting a better quality translator online soon.

Thank you to [Prof. Dieli](http://www.dieli.net/) and [Prof. Gaetano Cipolla](http://www.arbasicula.org/) for contributing their translations to this project and for their good advice and encouragement.  Their work made this project possible and their suggestions have been invaluable.  _Grazzi!_

After we assemble more parallel text, the translation quality will improve.  In the meantime, the trained model gets a few things right.  Below are a few examples:

```
>>> top_trans('the neapolitan and the sicilian', nu_trans=1)
the neapolitan and the sicilian
lu napulitanu e lu sicilianu

>>> top_trans('the large hat pays for all .', nu_trans=1)
the large hat pays for all .
cappiddazzu paga tuttu.

>>> top_trans('car@@ in@@ isi are dogs !', nu_trans=1)
car@@ in@@ isi are dogs !
cani carinisi!

>>> top_trans('it was the scissors !', nu_trans=1)
it was the scissors !
forfici foru!
```
